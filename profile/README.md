# The N# Language Group

Welcome to N# (sometimes called NSharp)! N# is an ongoing project that I work on when I feel like
it. Don't expect fast or consistent updates to this project.

## What actually is N#?

N# is a group of programming languages used to achieve a universal goal. The N# languages are a
mix of low and high levels of programming. Each language has a fairly easy-to-use syntax and can
both be interpreted by the SDK or compiled to a variety of different formats, including executables
and libraries for many processor types, a universal library format called "NSLib," and even to
other N# language formats, going from high-level to low-level languages.

N# will also come with a variety of low and high level libraries for physics, math, graphics, and
more. Focusing on the graphics library, a programmer will have a few choices for level of
programming and capabilities. If the programmer chooses a high-level version of the library,
graphics will be as easy as creating a camera, screen, and object and rendering the result. The
result will be more CPU-intensive, but if someone wants to make something quick and dirty then this
is the perfect option. On the other hand, if someone is a masochist and enjoys utilizing OpenGL to
its fullest extent, that is an option as well, with the low-level library being nothing but a wrapper
for direct access to GL.

Thanks for checking this out! I just want to make it clear that I'm not going to finish this
anytime soon. I'm just a solo guy and I'm by no means working on this 9-5. I work on it whatever
days I feel like it for however long I feel like it. So don't expect me to be consistent. It'll
likely be years before anything super meaningful happens here. Don't get hyped up.
